## **DTR:**  
Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
> We would like to build an application from scratch that is fully functional or at least close to fully functional. The driving force in this project is to help us make bigger and better code to eventually make bigger and better programs.

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
> Meet to discuss what portion of code we will work on and then divide the coding labor, and eventually circle back and talk about it to confirm the code. Occasionally, we will do driver-navigator processes. We both feel fine about paired programming and think that it is a great introduction into team coding.   

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
> Klaudia like to communicate best with in-person communication which will look like sharing screen or sharing screen-shots of code. Kevin thinks the same thing. We need a visual representation of what we are doing to understand the code. We appreciate receiving communication in a manner that is at any time of the day if it is pressing and we need help. We feel fine using tools like Slack, Zoom, and text.

How would you describe your work style?
> Klaudia's work style is look at the broad picture first and then start to figure out a solution one step at a time. She likes to get as much of the code work done after planning as possible at first and work on issues a bit later. Kevin has a similar work-style, but likes to work in the late hours of the night more so than Klaudia.

What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
> Klaudia's strength is listening. Kevin's strength is working out the small details. These complement each other because Klaudia is receptive to changes that Kevin might see.  

What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
> Well: Being able to finish iterations efficiently, reaching out to different people for a second set of eyes Poorly: Time spent troubleshooting failures or errors on game run, looking at code for too long when something is going wrong

How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
> We will set the direction of this project by making a plan board and we will make decisions on that plan by meeting together and talking through why we may have certain issues that may arise.

How will we overcome obstacles?
> We will overcome obstacles by attempting to work at it together, but if we are stuck after attempting, we will seek help from other people.

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
> We need respectful, open communication which is happening on a regular basis and we need to utilize our resources such as cohort mates and mentors in order to do our best work. We need a calm working environment so we do not stress each-other out.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
> We plan to have core team hours of at least 7-10pm on class days and more hours on the weekends. Scheduling are going to be played by ear outside of our core hours.

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
> We like to be clear, up-front, and respectful when giving feedback. Not much holds up back from giving the feedback we see fit.  

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
> Kevin has a strength in focusing on details of the code and feels that he can improve on the test making side of the code. Klaudia feels she has a bit of strength in the test making side of things, but feels she can improve on making class files. We can support each other by talking through code that relies our strengths and support each other on developing those codes.

What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
> Screen share for co-working sessions, Slack for communication, and we wish to utilize other peoples knowledge if we get stuck.

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
> We'd like to solve the problem together, never alone, and arrive at a solution we agree on together.  

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
> If the final result of the project is running and functioning as the game we made, we will know that it is successful. If we feel that we improved our development process during the project, we will know that this project was successful as well. We can achieve this by working together during the times we outlined above, working through the code together, and maintaining our working relationship.  

How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
> If we hit our milestones from our plan and feel secure in them, we will know we are successful. We can celebrate them by getting a little extra time of rest/relaxation if we meet our time goals.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
> Being in your computer space by yourself with proper lighting and maybe some music. You need to absolutely have Slack open and frequently open it to check for notifications.

When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
> Kevin has an outside job away from Turing, but he can rely on his co-workers to take care of business if he is working hard on code.

If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
> Kevin has a hotspot, Klaudia has a lobby that is available to use if wifi goes out.

Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will we hold ourselves accountable?
> Kevin will track when we need to take out Pom breaks.

Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
> How's your day going, type of polite ask to see where we each are at. Give advanced notice if something is wrong in the code rather than asking later when there's an additional 50 lines or it becomes an issue.

## **Template for DTR Memo**
Project: Mastermind  

Group Member Names: Kevin Nguyen, Klaudia Stewart

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
> We want to grasp the technical ideas of coding a bit better and want to learn how to develop projects with more than one person. If the final result of the project is running and functioning as the game we made, we will know that it is successful. If we feel that we improved our development process during the project, we will know that this project was successful as well. We can achieve this by working together during the times we outlined above, working through the code together, and maintaining our working relationship.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
> Klaudia's strength is listening (calm, cool, and collective). Kevin's strength is working out the small details and exhibit that back to the group (glass-window). These complement each other because Klaudia is receptive to changes that Kevin might see. Meet to discuss what portion of code we will work on and then divide the coding labor, and eventually circle back and talk about it to confirm the code. Occasionally, we will do driver-navigator processes. We both feel fine about paired programming and think that it is a great introduction into team coding.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
> We will overcome obstacles by attempting to work at it together, but if we are stuck after attempting, we will seek help from other people. Kevin can use his glass-window approach when Klaudia is stuck on the idea of a part of the code and Klaudia can use her calm, cool, collective approach when Kevin may not be getting ideas that she presents to him.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
> We are committing at least 7-10pm on lesson days, and will commit more hours on the weekend and the Monday where we don't have class. We do plan to work much individually as we want to share the code and understand it together. Our only constraints are are meeting with our mentors and other Turing scheduled events.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
> We will communicate at least once in the morning and afternoon. We plan to communicate very frequently on the weekends. We keep lines of communication open by keeping Slack notifications on and checking text messages. We will make decisions as a team by reading the code line by line and deciding what works best. If we need to take a break or are having emotional/mental well-being issues, we will address them in a professional manner.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
> Klaudia has the technical strength of identifying how to set up tests and Kevin has the technical strength of focusing on details. Klaudia wishes to see improvement in how each part of the code comes together (OOP) and Kevin wishes to see improvement in bi picture ideas as well.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
> We at least want to implement the feature of a user playing against the computer. Then, we'd at least like to get through the first extension of adding players.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
> We plan to see every piece of the workflow together at the very least in the planning phase.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
> Kevin will be responsible for using his Pom timer. We agree to not skip more than one consecutive Pom break.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
> We expect each other to be respectful and kind with attention to critical detail when necessary.

Additional Remote Considerations:
> Kevin has occasional in-person appointments, but can defer responsibilities to other work communications.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
> Zoom, Slack, GitHub, Trello

Day 1 Agenda:
> Finish DTR memo, initial planning for project

Additional Notes:
> To be determined...
